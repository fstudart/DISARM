PROJECT DISARM - Effects of ICS/LABA vs. LABA-only on the airway microbiome of COPD subjects

#Description: This is the first randomized controlled study designed to investigate the potential changes in the airway microbiome before and after treatment with two different ICS/LABA (budesonide/formoterol and fluticasone/salmeterol) formulations versus LABA-only (formoterol) in patients with COPD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02833480). 

Following informed consent, all patients were treated with formoterol (12 mcg BID) for four weeks. At the end of the run-in period, patients were randomized to one of three groups: 1) Budesonide 400 mcg + Formoterol 12 mcg BID; 2) Fluticasone 250 mcg + Salmeterol 50 mcg BID; or 3) Formoterol 12 mcg BID. Bronchial brushing (BC) samples were collected at randomization (Visit 3; V3 samples) and at week 12 (Visit 7; V7 samples). Library preparation and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene V4 region was performed on BC samples using the Illumina® MiSeq® platform. Sequencing reads were clustered into Amplicon Sequence Variants using the QIIME 2® (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology) pipeline.

Sequence data from all BC samples (n=119) used in this analysis have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the following accession numbers: BioProject PRJNA685554.
